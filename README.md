# React Portfolio (Rough - Not Complete)
The following is an attempt to create an incredibly dynamic portfolio utilizing React, a new styling language, and turned out to be an incredibl boiler plate for future development.

## Description

In this challenge, I wanted to push myself to create (at the very least) a fantastic landing page for prospecting employers, and ensuring that there are some elements that set my portfolio stand out from the rest. Having not reconfigured my portfolio page since the start of the bootcamp, I wanted to make this project have a semblance from the humblest roots to the humblest growth. Having learned how to make lovely animations, import icons, and styling in a language other than css, a (almost) functioning single-page application is the result produced thus far for future prospects.

## Installation

This project can be deployed utilizing github pages (link found in the right-hand side of repo) or one can clone the repository and launch from terminal by starting Node.

## Notes

As mentioned in the subtitle, the app works pretty well until it comes to showing the projects. In full disclosure, I worked on this project all day and night, pulling an all night and just now deciding to turn it in due to a heavy workload. BUT I am going to go back and see what improvements or configurations need to be made as soon as possible.
